# 📝 MY_WORK: Student Information, Development Log, Reflection & Answers

> This is the **only file** your instructor reads to grade Parts 3 and 4 (documentation and video). Everything you write here must be **in your own words**.

## 🛑 STOP: Read This Before You Do Anything Else

> ### 1️⃣ Read the whole `README.md` first
> The `README.md` in this repository contains the full instructions: how this assignment continues Assignment 1, the Chapter 5 recap, class descriptions, feature specifications, question prompts and the video script. **If you skip it, you will lose marks.**
>
> ### 2️⃣ Understand the full code before answering any question
> Open `SchedulerSimulationSync.java` and read it **from top to bottom**. You must be able to explain what `SharedStats`, `ReadyQueue`, `CpuWorker`, `RaceWindow.pause()`, `ReentrantLock` and `Semaphore` do **before** you write a single answer in Parts B and C. **Run the original starter first** (it is intentionally broken) and **save its output**: you need it for Question 1 of Part C.
>
> ### 3️⃣ Use only the code of this repository
> Work **only** on `SchedulerSimulationSync.java` from this repository. Do **not** copy or paste code from your previous assignments.
>
> ### 4️⃣ Commit many times, not once
> A single commit, or all commits made in the last hour, costs you **-0.5 mark**. See the [Commit Rules](#-commit-rules-mandatory) below.

**How to use this file:**
1. Fill in your **Student Information** (below) right now.
2. Follow the steps in the **Work Roadmap** in order.
3. Update the **Development Log** *every time* you work on the assignment, not at the end.
4. Do not delete any section header. Replace the `[...]` placeholders with your own text.

## 🔁 Commit Rules (MANDATORY)

> ### ⚠️ MANY COMMITS ARE REQUIRED. A single bulk commit is penalized (-0.5 mark).

**Minimum: 4 meaningful commits. Aim for 7 or more.**

| # | Commit | Example message |
|:-:|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Student ID set | `Set my student ID: 441234567` |
| 2 | Feature 1: Ready queue lock | `Feature 1: Protected the ready queue with a ReentrantLock` |
| 3 | Feature 2: Statistics locks | `Feature 2: Added locks to the shared statistics counters` |
| 4 | Feature 3: Semaphore | `Feature 3: Replaced busy waiting with a counting semaphore` |
| 5 | Development log entries | `Docs: Added development log entries 1-3` |
| 6 | Reflection and answers | `Docs: Completed reflection and technical answers` |
| 7 | Video link | `Docs: Added demo video link` |

**Rules:**
- ✅ **One commit per feature.** Do not put all three features in one commit.
- ✅ **Commit after each work session**, and after each part of this file.
- ✅ **Spread your commits over different dates.** Not all in one day.
- ❌ **Do not make all commits in the last hour** before the deadline (November 14, 2026).
- ❌ **No vague messages** like `done`, `update` or `final version`.

> 💡 **TIP:** Your commit history is checked and you **show it in your video** (at least 4 commits visible). Your development log dates should match your commit dates.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** **Use VS Code** (see *Recommended Development Environment* in `README.md` for the full setup). Sign in to GitHub in VS Code, then commit from the Source Control panel (Ctrl+Shift+G) → stage → write a message → Commit → Sync/Push. You can edit and commit this file the same way. **Pushing** matters: commits that are not pushed to GitHub are invisible to the instructor.

---

# Part A: Development Log (0.5 mark)

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Minimum **5 entries**, spread over **different dates**. Five entries written on the same day, or written all at once at the end, will lose marks and look like a copy. Entry dates should be **between the start of the assignment and the deadline (November 14, 2026)**.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Write an entry at the **end of each work session**, while you still remember what happened. It takes 5 minutes.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Be specific. "Worked on the code" is a weak entry. "Added a `ReentrantLock queueLock` to `ReadyQueue` and wrapped the body of `poll()` in `lock()` / `try` / `finally { unlock() }`" is a strong one.
>
> 📌 **NOTE:** Each entry needs: date and time, what you did, details, challenges, solution, and time spent. Real challenges are fine (and expected). Do not invent fake ones.

## Example Entry (do not copy it, write your own)

### Entry 1 - [November 2, 2026, 4:30 PM]
**What I did**: Forked the repository, set my student ID, and ran the original starter

**Details**:
- Forked the starter repository and renamed it
- Changed student ID on line 304 to my actual ID (441234567)
- Ran the original program: 4 CPUs started, three of them picked `P1`, then `IllegalThreadStateException` and the watchdog stopped the program
- Saved the output in a text file for Question 1
- Committed and pushed: `Set my student ID: 441234567`

**Challenges**: I did not understand why the same process was picked by three CPUs

**Solution**: Read `ReadyQueue.poll()` again and found the `RaceWindow.pause()` between reading the head and removing it

**Time spent**: 45 minutes

## Your Development Log

### Entry 1 - 10 Nov 2026 6:13PM
**What I did**:
- Set up the assignment.
**Details**:
- I forked the starter repository
  makopt/OS-Assignment3-Starter-481, renamed my fork to
  OS-Assignment3-Sedra-Arwany, kept it public, and cloned it into VS Code.
  I then set my student ID (445052829) in SchedulerSimulationSync.java
  (line 304) and committed it with the message
  "Set my student ID: 445052829".
**Challenges**:
- When I clicked "Sync Changes", VS Code showed a message saying
  I did not have permission to push to my own repository and offered to create
  a new fork.
**Solution**:
-  I cancelled the dialog instead of creating another fork. The
  problem was that VS Code was not signed in to my GitHub account, so I signed
  in again with my own account and the push worked. I then checked on
  github.com that the commit appeared.
**Time spent**:
1 hour

### Entry 2 - 12 Nov 2026 2:00PM
**What I did**:
-  I ran the original starter code three times without changing anything, to see the race conditions before fixing them.
**Details**:
I also read the code to find the shared data: the ready queue (list and map) and
  the three counters in SharedStats.
- Results: Runs 1 and 3 failed the verification. Process P2 was lost
  (its waiting and turnaround time stayed 0). Context switches were 33
  instead of 35, completed processes were 15 instead of 16, and total
  service time was 106263 instead of 111826. The missing 5563 ms is exactly
  the burst time of P2. The busy-waiting polls were 956 and 1063 instead
  of 0. Run 2 passed by luck, which shows that a race condition does not
  appear on every run.
**Challenges**:
- Understanding why P2 disappeared. I found that poll()
  reads the head of the queue and removes it in two separate steps, so two
  CPUs can read the same head and one of them then removes a different
  process.
**Solution**:
-  I saved the three outputs in text files to use them as
  evidence for the questions and the video.
**Time spent**:
15 minutes
---

### Entry 3 - 12 Nov 2026 2:15PM
**What I did**:
Feature 1 (Ready Queue Lock).

**Details**:
- I added a
  ReentrantLock (queueLock) to ReadyQueue class and wrapped every access
  to shared list and map in lock() /try/finally/unlock(): add(),
  poll(), processOf() and snapshot(). I used one lock for both list and map
  because they are always modified together. I kept the println in add()
  outside the lock because it does not touch the shared data.
- Results: I ran the program 5 times. No process was lost anymore
  (all 16 processes completed in every run, and P2 now has real waiting and
  turnaround times). The busy-waiting polls dropped from about 1000 in the
  starter to between 9 and 22. The verification still showed mismatches in
  context switches (32 to 34 instead of 35) and sometimes in total service
  time, which is expected because those counters are only fixed in Feature 2.

**Challenges**:
-  Understanding why lock must cover both read of the
  head and its removal in poll(): if the lock only protected one of the two
  steps, two CPUs could still read the same head.

**Solution**:
- I put whole body of poll() inside one critical section
  and used finally so the lock is always released, even when the method
  returns early on an empty queue.
**Time spent**:
30 minutes
---

### Entry 4 - 12 Nov 2026 2:20PM
**What I did**:
Feature 2 (Statistics Locks)

**Details**:
-  I declared three ReentrantLocks in SharedStats, one per shared variable (contextSwitchLock, completedLock, serviceTimeLock). I used lock() / try / finally / unlock() in the three update methods and also in the three getters, because a read in the middle of an update is not safe either
- Lock granularity: I chose one lock per variable because the three counters are independent: no operation needs to update two of them together. With a single lock, a CPU updating the service time would block another CPU that only wants to increment the context switch counter, which adds waiting for no reason
- Results: I ran the program 5 times. The first three verification lines (context switches 35, completed 16, service time 111826) were correct in all 5 runs. Only the busy-waiting line still failed (between 12 and 26 polls instead of 0), which is the goal of Feature 3

**Challenges**:
-  Finding why the totals were wrong even though no process was lost: the increments (read, pause, write) of two CPUs overlapped, so one update was lost

**Solution**:
- Putting the whole read-modify-write sequence inside the lock of its own variable.

**Time spent**:
30 minutes

---

### Entry 5 - 12 Nov 2026 3:44PM
**What I did**:
Feature 3 (Counting Semaphore)

**Details**:
- I added a Semaphore
  (processesAvailable, initial value 0) to ReadyQueue. add() calls
  release() after the process is really in the list, and each CPU now calls
  acquire() (through awaitProcess()) instead of polling the queue and
  sleeping for 20 ms. For the clean shutdown, the CPU that finishes the last
  process calls release(totalCPUs) so every CPU blocked on the semaphore
  wakes up, sees that all processes are completed and terminates
- Results: I ran the program 5 times. All verification lines were
  correct in every run (35 context switches, 16 completed processes, 111826
  ms of service time, 0 busy-waiting polls) and the program always
  terminated without the watchdog message

**Challenges**:
- Making the CPUs terminate. At first I only thought about the case where a process is available, but at the end the queue is empty and the CPUs would wait forever on acquire()

**Solution**:
- Releasing one permit per CPU when the last process completes, and checking the completed counter right after acquire().

**Time spent**:
about 1 hour

# Part B: Reflection (0.5 mark)

> 🛑 **STOP:** Do **not** start this part until you have read the `README.md`, read the **entire** `SchedulerSimulationSync.java`, run it, and finished the three features.
>
> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Each answer must be **5 to 7 sentences**, in **your own words**. Copied or AI-generated answers without understanding get **0 marks for the whole assignment**. You may be asked to explain them in person.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Mention concrete things you actually did: a method you wrote, an error you hit, a line of output you saw. Generic answers score low.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Draft your answer in a few bullet points first, then turn them into sentences.

## Question 1: What did you learn about synchronization?

> 💡 **TIP:** Talk about race conditions (read-modify-write), critical sections, mutual exclusion with `ReentrantLock` and `try/finally`, the role of a counting semaphore, and what surprised you when the starter failed.

**Your Answer:** *(5-7 sentences)*

[Write your answer here.]

## Question 2: What was the most challenging part of this assignment?

> 💡 **TIP:** Pick **one** specific challenge (understanding why the starter failed, choosing the lock granularity, the initial value of the semaphore, the shutdown of the CPUs, Git, the video) and say *why* it was hard.

**Your Answer:** *(5-7 sentences)*

[Write your answer here.]

## Question 3: How did you overcome the challenges you faced?

> 💡 **TIP:** Describe your method: reading the slides and the documentation, adding `System.out.println` to debug, running the program many times, re-reading the README, testing after each small change, asking for help.

**Your Answer:** *(5-7 sentences)*

[Write your answer here.]

## Question 4: Where can synchronization concepts be applied in real-world applications?

> 💡 **TIP:** Use real applications you know (banking and money transfers, ticket or seat booking, a shared counter on a website, a print queue, a database) and connect each one to what you built here (shared data, critical section, lock or semaphore).

**Your Answer:** *(5-7 sentences)*

[Write your answer here.]

### Optional: What would you like to learn more about?

[Any topics related to synchronization or operating systems that you're curious about?]

### Optional: How confident do you feel about synchronization concepts now?

[Beginner / Intermediate / Confident. What do you understand well? What needs more practice?]

### Optional: Feedback on the assignment

[Any comments? Was it helpful? Too easy or hard? Suggestions?]

# Part C: Technical Answers (0.5 mark)

> 🛑 **STOP:** You cannot answer these questions without understanding the code. Re-read `SchedulerSimulationSync.java` and **run it** first. Your answers must reference **your own code and your own output** (your student ID makes your output and your expected values unique).
>
> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Each answer must be **3 to 5 sentences**, with specific examples from your code or output. Use correct terms: race condition, critical section, mutual exclusion, mutex lock, semaphore, busy waiting, deadlock, producer, consumer.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Keep the output of the **original starter** and the output of your **final version** in text files or screenshots, so you can copy real snippets for Question 1.

## Question 1: Race Condition in Your Own Output

**Question**: Run the **original starter** (before any fix) and paste the **verification block** of that run. Which value was wrong (expected vs observed)? Explain **step by step**, with two named threads/CPUs, how **one lost update** happens on one of the shared variables (read, `RaceWindow.pause()`, write). Why can the same bug happen on a real machine even without `RaceWindow`, and why is it hard to detect?

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** The snippet must come from **your own run** (with your student ID), not from a classmate or from this README.
>
> 💡 **TIP:** Use a small timeline: *CPU-1 reads `contextSwitchCount` = 12 → CPU-2 reads 12 → CPU-1 writes 13 → CPU-2 writes 13 → one increment is lost.* If your starter run crashed before printing numbers, run it several times (or paste the exception and the watchdog message and explain it).

**Your Answer:** *(3-5 sentences)*

[Write your answer here.]

Verification block of the **original starter**:
```
[Paste the verification block (or the exception/watchdog message) of the starter here]
```

Verification block of **my final version**:
```
[Paste the verification block of your final version here (all lines ✔)]
```

**Explanation of the timeline:**
[Explain the lost update step by step.]

## Question 2: Critical Sections and Lock Granularity

**Question**: List the **critical sections** you protected (variables and methods) and the lock(s) you used. **Lock granularity:** did you use **one lock** for the three statistics or **one lock per variable**? Why, and what is the trade-off? Why is the **ready queue** protected by a **different** lock than the statistics? Explain how your solution provides **mutual exclusion**, and discuss **progress** and **bounded waiting** (a default `ReentrantLock` is not fair: what does that imply?).

> 💡 **TIP:** The three counters are independent: does updating `contextSwitchCount` need to block an update of `totalServiceTime`? Also think about what could go wrong (deadlock, or long waiting) if the queue lock and the statistics lock were the **same** lock and a thread held it while doing something slow.

**Your Answer:** *(3-5 sentences)*

[Write your answer here.]

| Critical section (variable / method) | Lock used | Why it needs protection |
|---|---|---|
| [e.g., `ReadyQueue.poll()`] | [lock name] | [reason] |
| [...] | [...] | [...] |

## Question 3: Busy Waiting vs Semaphore

**Question**: Describe the **busy waiting** of the starter and its cost (give the `Busy-waiting polls` number from your **starter** run). What does the **value of your semaphore** represent? What is its **initial value** and why? What is its value right after the `numProcesses` initial `add()` calls? Why does the last CPU call `release(totalCPUs)` at the end, and what would happen if it did not?

> 💡 **TIP:** Think about what a CPU does when the queue is empty in the starter, and what a CPU does in your final version (is it running, ready or blocked?). Also check what happens to a CPU blocked in `acquire()` when no process will ever be added again.

**Your Answer:** *(3-5 sentences)*

[Write your answer here.]

## Question 4: Classical Problems and Deadlock

**Question**: The CPUs and the ready queue look like a classical synchronization problem of Chapter 5. **Name it**, and say who plays the **producer** and the **consumer** roles (careful: here the CPUs also re-enqueue processes). If the ready queue were **bounded** (capacity `K`), name the **three semaphores** you would need and their **initial values**. Describe a **deadlock scenario** that appears if a thread acquired the **mutex before** waiting on the semaphore (or if two locks were acquired in different orders), and say **which of the four necessary conditions** you would break to prevent it.

> 💡 **TIP:** Recall the bounded-buffer solution of the slides (`empty`, `full`, `mutex`) and the order of `wait()` calls in the producer and the consumer. For the deadlock, think about a producer that holds the mutex while waiting for a free slot that only a consumer (who needs the mutex) can create.

**Your Answer:** *(3-5 sentences)*

**Classical problem and roles**:
[Name the problem; who is the producer, who is the consumer?]

**Semaphores for a bounded queue (name and initial value)**:
[Name the three semaphores and their initial values.]

**Deadlock scenario and prevention**:
[Describe the scenario and the necessary condition you would break.]
